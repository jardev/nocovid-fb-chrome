# No-Covid In Facebook

Are you annoyed with the "Information Center" panels about Covid-19 added to posts by Facebook? Or annoyed with many covid-related posts and comments?

This extension for Chromium-based browsers (Google Chrome, Chromium, Brave, etc) censors covid-related keywords and also removes the information panel added by Facebook to related posts. It also works in Firefox.

## How to use

Install the extension and enjoy. 

### Brave/Chrome/Chromium

Download the source code and put it somewhere in a folder. In your Chrome/Chromium/Brave browser go to the Extensions page, make sure the Developer mode is on, and then Load unpacked, choose the folder and enjoy.

### Firefox

Install the plugin from Firefox Browser ADD-ONS - [No Covid In Facebook](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-CA/developers/addon/no-covid-in-facebook) (it's on review though, should be ready in a few days)

## Chrome Web Store

Coming soon.
